# Imperial_Valley_Geomorphology_Map
Roughly maps the extent of basins, basin edges, and mountains in the Imperial Valley by grouping terrain classes from the Iwahashi et al. 2021 California terrian classification model. Terrain class groups were established by way of transects. The classes identified through them were then compared with satellite imagry and DEMs to determine outliers.
